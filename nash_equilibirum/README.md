# first_project

This aims to create a small games where ts will generate a population of 100 indivudals that will challenges each others over duel
The idea is to play a contamination game and see who trade the best

So each players will have a interaction as a trade with another player, the users will have the possibility to validate the trade first if they trust the other party.
If one party accept before the other, the other have the possibility to scam and steal from each others.


We will compute test to understand which personnality will tend to win the most overall.


They will be 3 types of characters for the moment:
- [NAIVE] one that always accept first no matter how much time he got scam
- [ADAPT] one that accept first but if get scam dont accept first anymore with the one that scam him before
- [BAD] one that always scam

We will have visuals to illustrate the results
