  \[
  \text{EBIT Margin} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Net Sales}} 
  \]

  \]

### **Leverage Ratios**

  \[
  \text{Debt to Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}} 
  \]

- **Total Debt to Equity**:
  
  \[
  \text{Total Debt to Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}} 
  \]

- **Long Term Debt to Assets**:
  
  \[
  \text{Long Term Debt to Assets} = \frac{\text{Long Term Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}} 
  \]

- **Debt to Assets**:
  
  \[
  \text{Debt to Assets} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}} 
  \]

- **Long Term Debt to Invested Capital**:
  
  \[
  \text{Long Term Debt to Invested Capital} = \frac{\text{Long Term Debt}}{\text{Invested Capital}} 
  \]

- **Total Debt to Invested Capital**:
  
  \[
  \text{Total Debt to Invested Capital} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Invested Capital}} 
  \]

- **Equity Multiplier**:
  
  \[
  \text{Equity Multiplier} = \frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Total Equity}} 
  \]
